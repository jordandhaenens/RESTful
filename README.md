# RESTful

This is a personal project to build a RESTful Web API following the architectual ideas outlined in Roy Fielding's dissertation, Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures, chapter 5. 

The first version of data served by the API will be dummy. V2 will serve data obtained from a web scraper.
